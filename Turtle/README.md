# Turtle
## Background

We were given two activities in class where the sample codes [turtley.py](turtley.py) and [shapesturtle.py](shapesturtle.py) were provided. 
I seem to have lost some versions of what I originally did for both activities but have included what remains in the Turtle folder of this repository.

### Activity 1

In the first case, we were challenged to draw our own shape and then attempt to create code for it. 

My final product was a replicating triangle creating a star [Star.jpg](Star.jpg). Here is the code: [Starburst.py](Starburst.py)

### Activity 2

The second activity was designed for us to explore Object Oriented Programming with Classes and Objects through the development of Shape classes.
I originally created a hexagon and wanted to explore flipping each iteration upside-down. I added a hexagon child class(file lost) and then lost interest.

I revisited the activity with a view to expanding the shapes with each interation, either in one place or randomly positioned and then using "random" to place iterations randomly in different places in the window.

Here are the results:
- [shapesturtle_expandshapes.py](shapesturtle_expandshapes.py)
- [shapesturtle_amended.py](shapesturtle_amended.py)
- [shapesturtle_increasingshapesrandom.py](shapesturtle_increasingshapesrandom.py)

 As resources or future reference, I invesigated a spiraling square [spiralsquare.py](spiralsquare.py) and [Increasing_Circles.py](Increasing_Circles.py) - link lost.
