## TKinter 

My early experiments were tedious and uninspiring but here they are:
- [tkintertut.py](tkintertut.py)
- [tkintertext.py](tkintertext.py)
- [tkinterframe.py](tkinterframe.py)

I then created [Interface.py](Interface.py) using https://www.javatpoint.com/simple-registration-form-using-tkinter-in-python as a guide.
