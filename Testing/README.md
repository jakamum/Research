# Testing

## A Slow Start

In the past, I have conducted a small amount of scaffolded Unit Testing. As a result, I'm still trying to understand the fundamentals of creating a Unit Test file for testing a program.

My explorations have resulted in one file thus far. I have included one [test](test.py) file with a single working test so far. 
I have also uploaded the [programme] that is being tested.
