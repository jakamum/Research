# Testing

## A Slow Start

In the past, I have conducted a small amount of scaffolded Unit Testing. As a result, I'm still trying to understand the fundamentals of creating a Unit Test file for testing a program.

My explorations have resulted in one file thus far. I have included one [test](test.py) file with a single working test so far. 
I have also uploaded the [program](Help_Desk_Ticket.py) and the accompanying module, [Ticket](Ticket.py) that is being tested, along with the other files [Utils](Utils.py) and [tickets](tickets.txt) needed to run the program.
